# 🚀 Modern Product Launch – Area

This project is a **responsive landing page** developed as part of my **Front-End studies**, representing the **first project I built in a more serious, structured, and professional way**.

Before this project, I had already created some smaller ones, mainly focused on **practicing basic concepts**.
With this project, the goal was to **simulate a real-world scenario**, applying Front-End best practices and proper version control.

During development, I **started adopting better Git practices**, such as more frequent and descriptive commits, improving my understanding of version control workflows throughout the process.

## 🧠 About the project

The landing page presents a fictional product called **Area**, a platform designed to **manage, visualize, and analyze business data**, helping companies gain clear insights into their operations.

The main focus of this project was:

* Semantic structure
* Modern layout
* Responsiveness
* Basic accessibility
* Organized and scalable code

---

## 🎨 Design

The design was taken from the **Figma Community**:

🔗 **Original design:**

The layout was used as a base, with small adaptations made when necessary during implementation.
